    <p>Jungle Pocket (Japanese: ジャングルポケット, 7 May 1998 – 2 March 2021) was a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a racing career which lasted from 2000 until 2002 he won five of his thirteen races and ¥704,258,000 in prize money. As a two-year-old he showed promising form by winning two races including the Grade III Sapporo Nisai Stakes in record time. In the following year he won the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby) and defeated an international field to win the Japan Cup.</p>

    <p>In Uma Musume: Pretty Derby, Jungle Pocket is portrayed as a mischievous umamusume that likes to boast. Her ultimate goal is to become the strongest runner ever, and she's not shy about telling everyone about it. Her famous quote "Follow my lead. I'll show ya who's the 'strongest'!" perfectly captures her confident and competitive spirit.</p>
    <p>Standing at 158cm tall with short light brown hair featuring four distinctive white streaks, Jungle Pocket has a unique appearance that matches her rebellious personality. She wears a side clip on the right side of her hair and has an ear decoration, while her yellow eyes reflect her fierce determination and playful nature.</p>
    <p>Before entering the world of official racing, Jungle Pocket was the leader of a group of ruffians in freestyle races. It was Fuji Kiseki's incredible racing performance that inspired her to transition into legitimate competition. Her "bros" continue to cheer her on as she smashes through the competition with her pumped-up attitude.</p>
    <p>Her relationships with other umamusume reflect her competitive nature - she's both friend and rival to Manhattan Cafe and Agnes Tachyon, having raced against them multiple times. Her roommate is Narita Top Road, and she shares a special connection with Tony Bianca, both having the habit of sticking their tongues out.</p>
    <p>Jungle Pocket's breakthrough victory came at the 2001 Japan Cup, where she defeated the legendary T.M. Opera O, effectively ending his racing dynasty. This victory solidified her reputation as a force to be reckoned with in the racing world, proving that her boastful claims weren't just empty words.</p>
