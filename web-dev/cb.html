        <p>Mr. C. B. (Japanese : ミスターシービー, April 7, 1980 - December 15, 2000) was a Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse and stud. In 1983 he won the Japanese Triple Crown, becoming the third horse to do so after St Lite and Shinzan. In recognition of this feat and his other strong showings, Mr. C. B. was named Japanese Horse of the Year for 1983 by the JRA, and would later be inducted into the Japan Racing Association Hall of Fame in 1986. </p>
