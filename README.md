# learning

just me figuring out code (╯°□°）╯

## what's in here

- `html-css/` - web dev basics 
- `javascript/` - making browsers cry

## why this exists

mostly so i can:
- track my progress without losing my mind
- be based with version control
- have proof i'm learning things
- stop rewriting the same thing 50 times

*work in progress... always*
